### (3) 2012 London Olympics

This exercise is similar to the Ikea furniture one, except that it will be
interactive. The data at this
[link](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/rzw8h2x6dp5693gdbpgxaf2koqijo12l) describes
all participants in the London 2012 Olympics. From an observable notebook, the
following code can be used to derive a new variable with a jittered Age
variable, which will be useful in part (a).

````js
import { vl } from "@vega/vega-lite-api"
import { aq, op } from "@uwdata/arquero"
data_raw = aq.fromCSV(await FileAttachment("All London 2012 athletes - ALL ATHLETES.csv").text())
data = data_raw.derive({Age_: d => d.Age + 0.25 * Math.random() })
````

a. Create a layered display that shows (i) the ages of athletes across sports
and (ii) the average age within each sport. Use different marks for participants
and for averages. To avoid overplotting, use the jittered `Age_` variable
defined in the code block above.

b. Sort the sports from lowest to highest average age. Add a tooltip so that
hovering over an athlete shows their name. Your results should look something
like the display in Figure \ref{fig:3}.

### (5) Language Learning

This problem will look at a simplified version of the data from the study _A
critical period for second language acquisition: Evidence from 2/3 million
English speakers_, which measured the effect of the the age of initial language
learning on performance in grammar quizzes. We have downloaded the raw data from
the supplementary material and reduced it down to the average and standard
deviations of test scores within (initial learning age) $\times$ (current
age-group) combinations. We have kept a column `n` showing how many participants
were used to compute the associated statistics. The resulting data are available
[here](https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/m53dea9w5ipczs3d7nqdnxqxx5ao501b.csv).

a) Using the `.derive()` command in arquero, create two new fields, `low` and
`high`, giving confidence intervals for the means in each row. That is, derive
new variables according to $\hat{x} \pm 2 * \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\hat{\sigma}$.
b) Create a `markArea`-based ribbon plot showing confidence intervals for
average test scores as a function of starting age. Include a line for the
average score within that combination. An example result is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:5}. Interpret the results of the study.
