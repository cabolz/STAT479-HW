# Problems

## (1) Ikea Furniture
```{r}
ikea <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/iat31h1wjg7abhd2889cput7k264bdzd.csv")
```

### Part A
```{r}
ggplot(ikea) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = category, y = price), col = 'gray70') + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  geom_jitter(aes(x = category, y = price), col = 'gray70') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + 
  labs(
    x = "Furniture Category",
    y = "Price (log scale)",
    title = "Ikea Furniture Category vs. Price"
  )
```
 

### Part B
```{r}
ikea$category = with(ikea, reorder(category, -price, mean))

ggplot(ikea) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = category, y = price), col = 'gray70') + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  geom_jitter(aes(x = category, y = price), col = 'gray70') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + 
  labs(
    x = "Furniture Category",
    y = "Price (log scale)",
    title = "Ikea Furniture Category vs. Price"
  )
```

### Part C
```{r}
highlight_df <- ikea %>% 
             filter(sellable_online == F)
ggplot(ikea) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = category, y = price), col = 'gray70') + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  geom_jitter(aes(x = category, y = price), col = 'gray70') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + 
  geom_point(data = highlight_df, aes(x = category, y = price), color = 'red') + 
  geom_label_repel(data = highlight_df, aes(x = category, y = price), 
                   label = highlight_df$name, col ='red3', size = 3, force = 2, 
                   max.overlaps = 20, fill = NA)+
  labs(
    x = "Furniture Category",
    y = "Price (log scale)",
    title = "Ikea Furniture Category vs. Price"
  )
```

## (2) Penguins

The data below measures properties of various antarctic penguins.

```{r}
penguins <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ijh7iipc9ect1jf0z8qa2n3j7dgem1gh.csv")
```


ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, y = species, fill = island)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = .7) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")

ggplot(gapminder_subset, aes(dollars_per_day, fill = group, y = ..count..)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7, bw = .12, position = "stack") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_x_log10(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0, 0.15, 0)) +
  facet_grid(year ~ .)


ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, col = species, group = island),
      alpha = 0.7, size = 0.9
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2")



i) How is bill length related to bill depth within and across species? 
ii) On which islands are which species found?


## (3) 2012 London Olympics

This exercise is similar to the Ikea furniture one, except that it will be
interactive. The data at this
[link](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/rzw8h2x6dp5693gdbpgxaf2koqijo12l) describes
all participants in the London 2012 Olympics. From an observable notebook, the
following code can be used to derive a new variable with a jittered Age
variable, which will be useful in part (a).

````js
import { vl } from "@vega/vega-lite-api"
import { aq, op } from "@uwdata/arquero"
data_raw = aq.fromCSV(await FileAttachment("All London 2012 athletes - ALL ATHLETES.csv").text())
data = data_raw.derive({Age_: d => d.Age + 0.25 * Math.random() })
````

a. Create a layered display that shows (i) the ages of athletes across sports
and (ii) the average age within each sport. Use different marks for participants
and for averages. To avoid overplotting, use the jittered `Age_` variable
defined in the code block above.

b. Sort the sports from lowest to highest average age. Add a tooltip so that
hovering over an athlete shows their name. Your results should look something
like the display in Figure \ref{fig:3}.
```{r}
#\begin{figure}
 # \centering
  #\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{/Users/kris/Desktop/olympics.png}
  #\caption{Example vega-lite result for Problem (3). Hovering over a tick mark
  #shows the name of the athlete.}
  #\label{fig:3}
#\end{figure}
```



## (4) Traffic
```{r}
traffic <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/x0mp3rhhic78vufsxtgrwencchmghbdf.csv")

ggplot(traffic, aes(x = date, height = value, y = name)) +
  geom_ridgeline(scale= .4, alpha = .3)+
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "City",
    title = "Traffic Over Time in German Cities"
  )
```


## (5) Language Learning

This problem will look at a simplified version of the data from the study _A
critical period for second language acquisition: Evidence from 2/3 million
English speakers_, which measured the effect of the the age of initial language
learning on performance in grammar quizzes. We have downloaded the raw data from
the supplementary material and reduced it down to the average and standard
deviations of test scores within (initial learning age) $\times$ (current
age-group) combinations. We have kept a column `n` showing how many participants
were used to compute the associated statistics. The resulting data are available
[here](https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/m53dea9w5ipczs3d7nqdnxqxx5ao501b.csv).

a) Using the `.derive()` command in arquero, create two new fields, `low` and
`high`, giving confidence intervals for the means in each row. That is, derive
new variables according to $\hat{x} \pm 2 * \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\hat{\sigma}$.
b) Create a `markArea`-based ribbon plot showing confidence intervals for
average test scores as a function of starting age. Include a line for the
average score within that combination. An example result is shown in Figure 5
```{r}
#\begin{figure}
 # \centering
  #\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{/Users/kris/Desktop/languages.png}
  #\caption{Example result for problem (5).}
  #\label{fig:5}
#\end{figure}
```



## (6) Deconstruction

![Article Visualization](\Users\bolzc\OneDrive\Documents\STAT479-HW\Q6-Graphic.jpg)

### Part A
Below are what I think the example columns are. There would be a row associated with each name/ID number
1. Names or ID numbers associated with each ticket recipient
2. Origin city of homeless traveler
3. Final Destination City
4. Average income of origin city
5. Average income of final city
6. Difference in income in two cities

### Part B
Listed below are the data types for the columns described in Part A
1. Character or integer
2. Character
3. Character
4. Numeric
5. Numeric
6. Numeric

### Part C
All of the origin cities start at the same point, giving the illusion that everyone starts in the same city. But really the origin city income is being compared to increase or decrease in the final destination city income. Each individual path represents a mark, since they represent a row. The difference in median income between the cites is encoded in in the lines we see from the origin point to the left. The count for each difference in median income is displayed through a density plot on the far right,. 



### Part D
Yes. The visualization shows if people went to cities that had a lower or higher median income. In addition, it also shows the density of how many people made that specific increase or decrease in median income.
